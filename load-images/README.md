# Load images

Load all images from a directory, one image per page.

It starts from the selected frame and creates an image of the frame size on each one of the following pages and loads the next image (alphabetically).

If the end of the document is reached, new pages are automatically creqated.

Warning: at the time of writing, the script cannot create new pages, if there are multiple master pages defined (facing pages...). You have to create enough pages before running the script (you can always remove the exceeding ones afterwards).
