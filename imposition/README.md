# Impose a Scribus file

Python script that calls Scribus from the shell to produce a _normal_ Pdf of the file and an _imposed_ Pdf.

Only very simple imposition plans are supported:

- it has been created to allow the printing of A6 _cards_ as double sided or booklet on A4.
- it's been expanded to support A6 _cards_ and printing on single sided A4 paper.
